pkgctl-license-setup(1)
=======================

Name
----
pkgctl-license-setup - Automatically detect and setup a basic REUSE
configuration

Synopsis
--------
pkgctl license setup [OPTIONS] [PKGBASE...]

Description
-----------

This subcommand automates the creation of the Arch Linux 0BSD package license
file as well as a basic reuse(1) configuration by applying simple heuristics.
It comes in especially handy when initially setting up licensing for a package
without the need to manually write a `REUSE.toml` file.

If any `.patch` files are detected and the PKGBUILD(5) has only a single entry
in the `license=()` array, this subcommand assumes the patches are licensed
under that license and generates annotations for them.

In case there are no patches, no additional annotations are generated.

Manual annotations are necessary in case the subcommand can't generate a
configuration that accounts for all files. In this case, `reuse lint` will fail
with a descriptive error of which files are missing an annotation.

If no `PKGBASE` is specified, the command defaults to using the current working
directory.

Options
-------

*-f, --force*::
	Overwrite existing reuse(1) configuration

*--no-check*::
	Do not run pkgctl-license-check(1) after setup

*-h, --help*::
	Show a help text
